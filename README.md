# Mars Data Scraping and Analysis
Welcome to our Mars Data Scraping and Analysis project! This exciting endeavor involves gathering information about Mars, including its latest news and weather patterns.

## Overview
This project is divided into two main parts:

1. Scraping Mars News

    We use automated tools to visit a Mars news website and extract news article titles and previews.

2. Analyzing Mars Weather Data

    We scrape data about Martian temperature and pressure, then analyze it to gain insights into the Martian climate.

## How to Run
To get started, follow these steps for each part:

### Part 1: Scraping Mars News

- Open the file part_1_mars_news.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.
- Run the provided code to fetch and display the latest news about Mars.

### Part 2: Scraping and Analyzing Mars Weather Data

- Open the file part_2_mars_weather.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.
- Execute the code to scrape and analyze Martian weather data.

## Technologies We Use
  We use a set of powerful tools to make this project possible:

    - Python: The main language we use for this project.
    - Pandas: Helps us process and analyze the scraped data.
    - Beautiful Soup: A tool to scrape data from web pages.
    - Splinter: Helps us automate web browsing and data retrieval.
    - Matplotlib: Allows us to visualize our findings.

## Results
Our analysis gives us a deeper understanding of Mars, its climate, and the latest news from the Martian world. We visualize our findings to make them easily understandable.
